            <h2>Illegal by Birth</h2>
            <p>Trevor Noah's birth by itself was a criminal act seeing as relationships between whites and blacks were
                criminalised. His mere existence was proof that this mother <br> had committed a crime by being with a
                white man. <br> Patricia was always afraid that her son could be taken away by the government. Trevor's
                existence was an act of criminality.</p>

                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-2xl"></i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                    traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.<i
                        class="fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-2xl"></i></p>
            </div>
            <p class='reflections' >This quote resonates with gender roles in today’s society. Women are expected to be
                submissive and their main role in a marriage is seen as that of bearing children and being a
                home-maker. Our society is largely patriarchal and any attempt by a woman to better herself is seen
                as a threat to the status quo. Abel was threatened by Patricia’s determination to be
                independent and stand on her own, which is seen in his attempts to undermine her works and the
                physical violence inflicted on her. <br> <br>A study conducted in 2022, in South Africa revealed that 40% of
                South African men believe a wife must prioritise family over personal ambitions. This reflects
                a disconnect as more women are getting empowered and desire to lead independent lives, while
                most men are still stuck in the notion that a woman’s place is in the kitchen. <br><br>
                Abel’s desire to cage Patricia is a literal attempt to confine and own her. Patricia's refusal to
                be caged is seen in her decision to leave him despite the cultural stigma. <br><br> Over 40% of women
                in Kenya have experienced intimate partner violence, and there were 170 femicide cases in Kenya in
                2024. All of these grim statistics are desperate attempts by weak partners like Abel to cage
                their wives.
                Patricia’s escape from the cage that Abel was trying to confine her in offers hope to women stuck
                in toxic relationships that there is still a way out. <br><br>
                Today, women are becoming vocal and rejecting subservience as observed from movements like
                #totalShutdown in South Africa and #endFemicideKe in Kenya which protest against gender based violence
                and patriarchal norms.
